# ðŸŽ¬ Media Player

MQTT integration for a media player is not supported by home assistant, so a custom addon must be installed. Using HACS you can install the [MQTT Media Player](https://github.com/bkbilly/mqtt\_media\_player) integration for creating a new `media_player` entity.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](.gitbook/assets/hacs\_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs\_repository/?owner=bkbilly\&repository=mqtt\_media\_player\&category=integration)

Once installed you need to restart your Home Assistant instance and add the `MQTT Media Player` integration from `devices & services` page. You can find the appropriate input name under the logs of LNXlink.

It supports playing remote or local media using `cvlc` which should be installed on your system.
