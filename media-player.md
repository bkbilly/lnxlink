# ðŸŽ¬ Media Player

**Note:** Home Assistant does not natively support MQTT integration for media players, so a custom add-on must be installed. Using **HACS**, you can install the **MQTT Media Player** integration to create a new `media_player` entity.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](.gitbook/assets/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=bkbilly\&repository=mqtt_media_player\&category=integration)

After installation, restart your Home Assistant instance and add the MQTT Media Player integration from the **Devices & Services** page. You can find the correct input name by checking the **LNXlink** logs.

This setup supports playing both local and remote media using one of the following backends: `cvlc`, `gst-play-1.0`, `ffplay`, `mpv`, or `vlc` â€” make sure at least one of these is installed on your system.
