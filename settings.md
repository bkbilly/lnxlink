# ðŸ”— Settings

## SystemD

Not all services on a machine are needed to be controlled or monitored through a switch, so they need to be configured manually by adding this on your _config.yaml_ file:

```yaml
settings:
  systemd:
    - docker.service
    - anydesk.service
```

## GPIO

This is only supported by Raspberry Pi and needs to be configured manually on your _config.yaml_ file:

```yaml
settings:
  gpio:
    inputs:
      - name: Front Door
        pin: 13
        device_class: door
    outputs:
      - name: Siren
        pin: 25
        icon: mdi:bullhorn
```

## Keyboard Hotkeys

This is used to run remote commands to your Home Assistant instance using keyboard shortcuts. Pynput is used for the keys syntax and the monitoring of presses.

```yaml
settings:
  hotkeys:
  - key: <ctrl>+<alt>+s
    type: state  # Shows a notification using zenity with the state of the entity
    entity_id: light.myroom
  - key: <ctrl>+<alt>+a
    type: action  # Perform an action on Home Assistant
    service: light.toggle
    entity_id: light.myroom
  - key: <ctrl>+<alt>+z
    type: conversation  # Sends a predefined text to Home Assistant and displays a notification with the result
    text: What is the water heater temperature?
  - key: <ctrl>+<alt>+x # Same as conversation, but a zenity popup with an entry is displayd for the user to write
    type: popup
```

## Bash

Using this option you can create `sensors` or `buttons` that run custom commands:

```yaml
settings:
  bash:
    expose:
    - name: Prune Docker
      type: button
      command: docker system prune -af
      icon: mdi:script-text
    - name: Load 1minute
      type: sensor
      command: cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1}'
      unit: load
```

<details>

<summary>Create Bash sensors on Home Assistant side</summary>

The bash module can run any command on a remote computer which makes it dangerous, but also very helpful to create sensors without creating modules on LNXlink.

You will need to create a new sensor on your Home Assistant configuration file like so:

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Test ls"
      unique_id: "test_ls"
      state_topic: "lnxlink/desktop-linux/command_result/bash/bash_command/test_ls"
      availability:
        - topic: "lnxlink/desktop-linux/lwt"
          payload_available: "ON"
          payload_not_available: "OFF"
```

Then you must create an automation to run on an interval to get the result of a command:

```yaml
alias: Get files count
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    seconds: "40"
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: lnxlink/desktop-linux/commands/bash/bash_command/test_ls
      payload: ls ~/Downloads | wc -l
```

</details>

## Disk usage

By default this module finds all connected drives and exposes them to Home assistant, but this can be changed by setting them manually on settings with the include\_disks option:

```yaml
settings:
  disk_usage:
    include_disks:
      - /dev/sda
      - /dev/sdb
```

Using the exclude\_disks option it finds all connected drives, but excludes from exposing the ones in this configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  disk_usage:
    exclude_disks:
      - /dev/sda
      - /dev/sdb
```

## Mounts usage

Checks the usage of mounted volumes on the system. If autocheck is `true`, it will use the Gnome GVFS to find volumes mounted by the file browser.

```yaml
settings:
  mounts:
    autocheck: false
    directories:
      - /mnt/mymount
```
